The observation is, that all semi-primes have exactly four factors. (can also be proved eaisly) 
But, all numbers having four factors are of two types. Both semi-primes and perfect cubes will always have 4 factors.
So, we iterate over all numbers, check if it has exactly four factors (including trivial factors) and is not perfect cube.
If any number satisfy both criteria, it is marked as semi-prime.
